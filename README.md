# Flash Chat ⚡️

## My Goal

The objective of this App is to incorporate Firebase into my Flutter apps. I'll be using Firebase Cloud Firestore as well as the Firebase authentication package to equip my app with a cloud based NoSQL database and secure authentication methods.

## What Will I create

I am going to build a modern messaging app where users can sign up and log in to chat.

## What skills will this app show

- Incorporate Firebase into your Flutter projects.
- Use Firebase authentication to register and sign in users.
- Create beautiful animations using the Flutter Hero widget.
- Create custom aniamtions using Flutter's animation controller.
- Streams and how they work.
- Use ListViews to build scrolling views.
- Use Firebase Cloud Firestore to store and retrieve data on the fly.
